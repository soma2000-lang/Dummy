EnvisEdge allows users to simulate an edge computing environment to test their ideas and models before putting them in place on the edge. It takes care of all the complex stuff such as diversity across operating systems, computation power and communication mediums, allowing you to focus on the idea rather than the setup.

EnvisEdge allows researchers, developers and data scientists to experiment and test their hypotheses, and produce production-ready code without having direct access to the edge devices. Creating a path for global research and growth in the domains of federated learning and edge computing.


## Key features :star2:  

1. Provides a platform for global or remote teams to run and test their systems/models prior to deployment.
2. Run, train and test FL algorithms and ML models.
3. Can setup environment of your choice with any arbitrary hardware constraints such as RAM, CPU and more.
4. Experience Edge on cloud and your devices.

# Quickstart
Update the config files of the model (can be found [here](https://github.com/NimbleEdge/EnvisEdge/tree/main/configs)) you are going to use with logging directory:

```yml
log_dir:
  PATH: <path to your logging directory>
```

Download kafka from [Here](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/kafka/3.1.0/kafka_2.13-3.1.0.tgz) üëà
and start the kafka server using the following commands

```bash
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```
Create kafka topics for the job executor

```bash
cd scripts
$ bash add_topics.sh
Enter path to kafka Directory : <Enter the path to the kafka directory>
kafka url: <Enter the URL on which kafka is listening e.g if you are running it on localhost it would be 127.0.0.1>
Creating Topics...
```
## Installation
Install the dependencies using virtual environment
```bash
mkdir env
cd env
virtualenv envisedge
source envisedge/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the federated dataset

```bash
$ bash download.sh -f
Enter global data path : <Enter the path you want your dataset to be saved>
Enter model : <Enter the config file of the model to update with the dataset path>
Downloading femnist dataset...
```

Run data preprocessing with [preprocess_data](preprocess_data.py) . Using this dataset, you will prepare a client_id mapping in the dataset that will be sent to Python workers for training the model.
```bash
python preprocess_data.py --config configs/regression.yml
```

To start the multiprocessing executor run the following command:

```bash
$ python executor.py --config configs/regression.yml
```
To see how traning is done run the following command:
```bash
$ python tests/integration_tests/integration_test.py --config configs/regression.yml
```
