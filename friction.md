# Documentation Friction Log

This log lists all the glitches that makes the [DBDP documentation](https://github.com/DigitalBiomarkerDiscoveryPipeline/Digital_Health_Data_Repository) hard to use, but frames it around a narrative  use case. Each log item can be created as issues so thier progress can be tracked.

## User Friction

These are frictions of [DBDP documentation](https://github.com/DigitalBiomarkerDiscoveryPipeline/Digital_Health_Data_Repository)  framed around a customer(user) use case.

Title    |          Description
 ------------------------| ---------


 |Contribution guidelines | A more detailed and easily understandable guideline for open source enthusiasts to easily contribute to the current documentation.
 |Broken Links | 
 |Add image to existing product | Improved the guidelines on how to add photo to an existing product irrespective of file type etc.
 |Case Study| Create real-life sample tutorials on how to build with the Open Food Facts database (either articles or video tutorials)
 |Glossary | Build a glossary for all technical terms in this project
 |Visibility | The documentation isnt easy to see , at least it should be visible in the project landing page and github .
 |Navigation | Current documentation is overcrowded and difficult to navigate. The side navbar section does not stay in the same place when the user scrolls down, this makes the docs harder to use since the user has to scroll upwards again to find new information within the docs.
 |Broswer compatibility | It does not display in firefox
 |News & Updates | A News & Updates section where users are informed of the updates that have been made to the documentation.
 |Local Machine Server |  We may have a developers note section for things that developers should take not of . for example this.
 |How to contribute to the Open API file | If changes were to be made to the open api spec file , add a guideline to help people know a few things about the open api file and how to contribute to it.

## Future Proposals

After the new documention shipped its first phase, these plans can be looked at to improve community contributions.

### Proper contributor follow-up and community check-in

Create good first issues, do follow ups on contributors for these issues and keep improving contributors guideline. Schedule weekly/biweekly contributors meet/newcomers call so new contributors can habe a great headstart with contributing to the project.

## Developer Friction

These are frictions of framed around a developer/documentation contributor use case.

Title    |          Description
 ------------------------| ----------
 |Proximity | The documentation isn't close to the code
 |Review    | Changes should be reviewable via Github Pull Requests
 |Test      | Run tests on the proposed changes in the documentation before any merge is made to the main documentation.

## API Friction Log

During the survey , some frictions were discovered that resulted from the API itself. They are key things for the developers to look out while building the next API version.

Title    |          Description
 ------------------------| ---------
 |Search| Current API: not being able to do a precise search on product name. E.g _The database result are working fine for normal products like “Milk” but when I try to query for a fruit or vegetable like “Apple” the results always show me products like “Apple juice”, “Apple rings”  instead of the actual product I'm searching for which is an Apple._
 |Add image to existing product | In a future version of the API, having a field name for the image that does not change depending on the image type or language.
